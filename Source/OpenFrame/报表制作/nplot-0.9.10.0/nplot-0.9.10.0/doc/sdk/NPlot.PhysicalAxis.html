      <p> This class adds physical positioning information [PhysicalMin, PhysicalMax] and related functionality on top of a specific Axis class. It's an interesting question where to put this information. It belongs with every specific axis type, but on the other hand, users of the library as it is normally used should not see it because positioning of axes is handled internally by PlotSurface2D. Therefore it doesn't make sense to put it in the Axis class unless it is internal. But if this were done it would restrict use of this information outside the library always, which is not what is wanted. The main disadvantage with the method chosen is that there is a lot of passing of the positional information between physical axis and the underlying logical axis type. C# doesn't have templates. If it did, I might derive PhysicalAxis from the templated Axis type (LinearAxis etc). Instead, have used a has-a relationship with an Axis superclass. </p>
